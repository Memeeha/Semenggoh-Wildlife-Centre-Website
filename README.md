COS30049 COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION PROJECT

# Semenggoh Wildlife Centre Website

This project includes the website code and IoT integration for the Semenggoh Wildlife Centre. The codebase is divided into different components, including the website code, IoT functionality, and Firebase setup.

## Project Structure

The project files are organized as follows:

1. **COS30049 PROJECT.zip**  
   This contains the code for the **Semenggoh Wildlife Centre website**.

2. **teasall.zip** and **Webcam.zip**  
   These contain the **IoT code** for the system's functionality, which includes the integration of sensors and webcam for monitoring.

3. **firebase**  
   This directory contains the configuration and setup for **Firebase**, including all required Firebase configurations for real-time data synchronization.

4. **firebasesrc**  
   This folder includes additional Firebase source code for the IoT system integration.

5. **.gitignore**  
   This file ensures that unnecessary or sensitive files are excluded from being tracked by Git (e.g., node_modules, environment variables).

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Website Code
To work with the website code:
1. Extract the contents of **COS30049 PROJECT.zip**.
2. Open the extracted files in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Install necessary dependencies and start the website server based on the instructions provided within the project files.

### 2. IoT Code
The IoT system is stored in two separate ZIP files: **teasall.zip** and **Webcam.zip**. These files contain the code required for the device-side functionalities. To set up the IoT system:
1. Extract the **teasall.zip** and **Webcam.zip** files.
2. Follow the instructions within these files to set up the devices, including the camera and sensors.

### 3. Firebase Setup
To enable Firebase for real-time data management:
1. Extract the **firebase** and **firebasesrc** folders.
2. Follow the setup instructions in the Firebase configuration files to link your project with Firebase services.
3. Ensure your Firebase credentials and environment variables are correctly set in the project.
